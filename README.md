# tindog
Developed an application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that mimics the functionality of the popular dating app, Tinder, but for dogs and their owners. Utilized Bootstrap framework to make the app responsive and mobile-friendly. Implemented the Swipe feature, where users can swipe left or right to indicate interest in other dogs and their owners.
